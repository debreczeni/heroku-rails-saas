Heroku Rails SaaS
=============

Easier configuration and deployment of Rails apps on Heroku

Configure all your Heroku enviroments via a YML file (config/heroku.yml) that defines all your environments, addons, and environment variables.
Configure your app specific Heroku environment via a YML file (config/heroku/awesomeapp.yml) thats defines all your environments, addons, and 
environment variables for awesomeapp.

## Install

### Rails 3

Add this to your Gemfile:

    group :development do
      gem 'heroku-rails'
    end

## Configure

In config/heroku.yml you will need add the Heroku apps that you would like to attach to this project. You can generate this file and edit it by running:

    rails generate heroku:config

If you want to defined more 

### Example Configuration File

For all configuration settings

    config:
      BUNDLE_WITHOUT: "test:development"
      CONFIG_VAR1: "config1"
      CONFIG_VAR2: "config2"

    # Be sure to add yourself as a collaborator, otherwise your
    # access to the app will be revoked.
    collaborators:
      - "my-heroku-email@somedomain.com"
      - "another-heroku-email@somedomain.com"

    addons:
      - scheduler:standard
      # add any other addons here

For an app specific settings awesomeapp

    apps:
      production: awesomeapp
      staging: awesomeapp-staging
      legacy: awesomeapp-legacy

    stacks:
      bamboo-mri-1.9.2

    production:
      CONFIG_VAR1: "config1-production"

    collaborators
      - "awesomeapp@somedomain.com"

    domains:
      production:
        - "awesomeapp.com"
        - "www.awesomeapp.com"

    production:
      - ssl:piggyback
      - cron:daily
      - newrelic:bronze


### Setting up Heroku

To set heroku up (using your heroku.yml), just run.

    rake all heroku:setup

This will create the heroku apps you have defined, and create the settings for each.

Run `rake heroku:setup` every time you edit the heroku.yml. It will only make incremental changes (based on what you've added/removed). If nothing has changed in the heroku.yml since the last `heroku:setup`, then no heroku changes will be sent.


## Usage

After configuring your Heroku apps you can use rake tasks to control the
apps.

    rake <app_name>:production heroku:deploy

A rake task with the shorthand name of each app is now available and adds that
server to the list that subsequent commands will execute on. Because this list
is additive, you can easily select which servers to run a command on.

    rake <app_name>:demo <app_name>:staging heroku:restart

A special rake task 'all' is created that causes any further commands to
execute on all heroku apps (Note: Any environment labeled `production` will not
be included, you must explicitly state it).

Futhermore there are rake task 'environments' created from environments in configs
that causes any further commands to execute on all heroku apps.

    rake all:production heroku:info

Need to add remotes for each app?

    rake all heroku:remotes

A full list of tasks provided:

    rake all                        # Select all non Production Heroku apps for later command
    rake all:production             # Select all Production Heroku apps for later command
    rake heroku:deploy              # Deploys, migrates and restarts latest code.
    rake heroku:apps                # Lists configured apps
    rake heroku:info                # Queries the heroku status info on each app
    rake heroku:console             # Opens a remote console
    rake heroku:capture             # Captures a bundle on Heroku
    rake heroku:remotes             # Add git remotes for all apps in this project
    rake heroku:migrate             # Migrates and restarts remote servers
    rake heroku:restart             # Restarts remote servers

    rake heroku:setup               # runs all heroku setup scripts
    rake heroku:setup:addons        # sets up the heroku addons
    rake heroku:setup:collaborators # sets up the heroku collaborators
    rake heroku:setup:config        # sets up the heroku config env variables
    rake heroku:setup:domains       # sets up the heroku domains
    rake heroku:setup:stacks        # sets the correct stack for each heroku app

    rake heroku:db:setup            # Migrates and restarts remote servers

You can easily alias frequently used tasks within your application's Rakefile:

    task :deploy =>  ["heroku:deploy"]
    task :console => ["heroku:console"]
    task :capture => ["heroku:capture"]

With this in place, you can be a bit more terse:

    rake all:staging console
    rake all deploy

### Deploy Hooks

You can easily hook into the deploy process by defining any of the following rake tasks.

When you ran `rails generate heroku:config`, it created a list of empty rake tasks within lib/tasks/heroku.rake. Edit these rake tasks to provide custom logic for before/after deployment.

    namespace :heroku do
      # runs before all the deploys complete
      task :before_deploy do

      end

      # runs before each push to a particular heroku deploy environment
      task :before_each_deploy do

      end

      # runs after each push to a particular heroku deploy environment
      task :after_each_deploy do

      end

      # runs after all the deploys complete
      task :after_deploy do

      end
    end
